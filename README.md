# Smart Home Management System

## Overview  
This project is a **Smart Home Management System** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system allows users to manage and monitor various smart devices in their home. Since we don't have real-world data, we used **dummy data** for testing and demonstration purposes.  

## Tech Stack Used  
- **MongoDB** â†’ For storing device data  
- **Express.js** â†’ Backend API  
- **React.js** â†’ Frontend UI  
- **Node.js** â†’ Server-side logic  
- **Postman** â†’ Used to test API requests and upload data  

## Features  
âœ… **Add Smart Devices** â†’ Users can register devices like lights, fans, and sensors.  
âœ… **Monitor Devices** â†’ View real-time status of connected devices.  
âœ… **Control Devices** â†’ Toggle device states (on/off).  
âœ… **API Testing with Postman** â†’ Used for debugging and data uploads.  
âœ… **MongoDB Storage** â†’ Stores device information and user preferences.  

## Project Setup  

# Smart Home Dashboard

A full-stack smart home dashboard that allows users to manage their IoT devices.

## 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-home.git
cd smart-home
```

## 2. Install Dependencies  
### Backend:  
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Frontend:  
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## ðŸ“Œ Smart Home Dashboard UI  
*(Insert UI screenshots here.)*

## ðŸ“Œ Dummy Data Example (Uploaded via Postman)  
*(Insert screenshots of Postman requests and MongoDB collections here.)*

## 3. Set Up MongoDB  
Ensure MongoDB is installed and running. Update your `.env` file with your MongoDB URI:

```plaintext
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/smarthome
```

## 4. Run the Project  
### Backend:  
```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend:  
```bash
npm start
```

## API Endpoints (Tested in Postman)  
| Method | Endpoint           | Description         |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| GET    | /api/devices      | Get all smart devices |
| POST   | /api/devices      | Add a new device   |
| PUT    | /api/devices/:id  | Update device state |
| DELETE | /api/devices/:id  | Remove a device    |

## Future Improvements  
- ðŸ”¹ Real-world device integration (IoT)  
- ðŸ”¹ User authentication  
- ðŸ”¹ Voice command support
