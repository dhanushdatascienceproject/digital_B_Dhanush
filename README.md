Smart Home Management System
Overview
This project is a Smart Home Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system allows users to manage and monitor various smart devices in their home. Since we don't have real-world data, we used dummy data for testing and demonstration purposes.

Tech Stack Used
MongoDB â†’ For storing device data
Express.js â†’ Backend API
React.js â†’ Frontend UI
Node.js â†’ Server-side logic
Postman â†’ Used to test API requests and upload data
Features
âœ… Add Smart Devices â†’ Users can register devices like lights, fans, and sensors.
âœ… Monitor Devices â†’ View real-time status of connected devices.
âœ… Control Devices â†’ Toggle device states (on/off).
âœ… API Testing with Postman â†’ Used for debugging and data uploads.
âœ… MongoDB Storage â†’ Stores device information and user preferences.
