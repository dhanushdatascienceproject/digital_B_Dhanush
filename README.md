# Smart Home Management System

## Overview  
This project is a **Smart Home Management System** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system allows users to manage and monitor various smart devices in their home. Since we don't have real-world data, we used **dummy data** for testing and demonstration purposes.  

## Tech Stack Used  
- **MongoDB** â†’ For storing device data  
- **Express.js** â†’ Backend API  
- **React.js** â†’ Frontend UI  
- **Node.js** â†’ Server-side logic  
- **Postman** â†’ Used to test API requests and upload data  

## Features  
âœ… **Add Smart Devices** â†’ Users can register devices like lights, fans, and sensors.  
âœ… **Monitor Devices** â†’ View real-time status of connected devices.  
âœ… **Control Devices** â†’ Toggle device states (on/off).  
âœ… **API Testing with Postman** â†’ Used for debugging and data uploads.  
âœ… **MongoDB Storage** â†’ Stores device information and user preferences.
